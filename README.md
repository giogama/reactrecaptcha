# Using Google reCAPTCHA on React
![Google reCAPTCHA](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/images/newCaptchaAnchor.gif)

## :eyes: Overview
Google offers reCAPTCHA (v3 and v2) and reCAPTCHA tool to help you protect your sites from fraudulent activities, spam, and abuse. That's why, this project stands for creating a Web Form using React and protecting it from bots submiting nonsense data only for flooding your database with trash data and furthermore, it may have the possibility of triggering a denial of service attack.

## :warning: Important
Despite Google offers reCAPTCHA in 2 versions, this project is going to follow the **version 2 (v2)**.

## :technologist: Audience
This project is designed for people familiar with HTML forms, React App, server-side processing and typescript development.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Prerequisites
To start using reCAPTCHA, you need to sign up for an API key pair for your site. The key pair consists of a site key and secret key. The site key is used to invoke reCAPTCHA service on your site or mobile application. The secret key authorizes communication between your application backend and the reCAPTCHA server to verify the user's response. The secret key needs to be kept safe for security purposes.
